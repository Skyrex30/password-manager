# password-manager
This is a password manager I developed as part of a university project to learn and showcase my skills in Java. The application securely stores passwords using AES encryption and features an interactive user interface for adding, viewing, saving, and loading passwords. To enhance the experience, I included session timeout locking, background music, and sound effects. I also implemented a password generator and ensured a clean, organized structure with Java packages. For efficiency and modern coding practices, I utilized Java Streams in the project.
